This blog is made to answer the analysis questions stated in the 'Project' section of my website. As a reminder, we will answer the following questions:




What is the team free throw percentage for the Milwaukee Bucks on the first free throw during the 2024 season so far?

What is the team free throw percentage for the Milwaukee Bucks on the second free throw during the 2024 season so far?

When favorited at home, how often do the Milwaukee Bucks win that game?

How often do the Milwaukee Bucks call a timeout when the away team scores?




I hope you enjoy the website and analysis. I worked very hard on this. Thank you for being here!
